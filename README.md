# Brief explanation about the problem & the project
People are having difficulty recalling the exact names of movies and TV shows when they want
to re-watch them, but they can recall a summary of the plot. People are accustomed to taking
several different actions as a solution to this issue. Certain community forums found in social
media such as Facebook and Reddit can be cited as examples. 'Tip of My Tongue' Reddit
thread and 'Incredibly Strange Films' Facebook group can be given as examples to those
community forums. In those forums, there are thousands of requests to find a movie that
matches up to a particular description. In some cases, they are answered, but it took a long
time to get such a correct guess. A large number of requests that go unanswered can also be
noticed.
